# Sudoku Solver

Although this project is working in terms of solving the puzzles it is incomplete in terms of the UI. I have moved on to other projects for now that are more important, but I do plan on finishing it and also creating visualisation of the solve as it happens.

### To use

Please remember this is an unfinished project, you can use it https://mikehulme.co.uk/Sudoku/sudoku.html

Just keep clicking the three buttons in any order, each button looks to solve the next number in a different way.

if you want to change the puzzle you, for now you need to change the array in the scripts file. a 0 represents an empty square.

### Still need to implement

* Ability for user to enter their own puzzle
* Ability to generate a random puzzle
* Better user interface
* Better explanation of how the last number was solved
* Implement visualization of the solve
* Make it responsive
